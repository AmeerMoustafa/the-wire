A simple websocket chat app with session cookie authentication. I was inspired by retro hacker culture and took it as a chance to learn some Go + HTMX.

# What I learned:

- Basics of HTMX
- Session cookies in the Go std lib
- Basics of creating a rest API with the Go std lib
- Creating a websocket server with the Go std lib
